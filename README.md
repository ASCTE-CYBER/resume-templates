### 3. Keep Only Your Template
1. Delete the other template files.

3. Keep the matching `.css` file (don’t rename it).

### 4. Create a Branch and Customize Your Resume
Instead of editing `main` directly, you’ll practice **branching + pull requests**.

1. In your repo, create a **new branch** (name it `resume-edit` or something similar).  
2. Switch to that branch.  
3. Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder info with **your details**:
   - Name + title  
   - Contact info (email, GitHub, LinkedIn, phone)  
   - Education & graduation year  
   - Skills (Python, Linux, CyberPatriot, Robotics, etc.)  
   - Projects, clubs, and awards  
   - (Optional) Add your profile picture  
4. Commit your changes on this branch.  
5. Push your branch to GitHub.  
6. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch → `main`.  
7. Merge your PR once you’ve reviewed your changes.  

💡 Pro Tip: Small commits are better — commit after each section you edit.

### 5. Publish With GitHub Pages
1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in your repo.  
2. Under **Build and Deployment**:
   - Source = `Deploy from branch`
   - Branch = `main` → `/root`
   - Click **Save**  
3. Wait ~30 seconds.  
4. Your live site will be at:  
   `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`

### 6. Show Off Your Site 🎉
- Open your link in a new tab to confirm it works.  
- Share it on Canvas for this assignment.  

---

## 🏆 Extra Challenge (Optional)
- Customize colors in your `.css` file.  
- Add an image or background.  
- Make your resume unique!
